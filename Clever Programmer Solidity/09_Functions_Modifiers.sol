/*
Explanation:

1. We start by defining a contract named 'Modifiers' in Solidity.

2. Inside the contract, we declare a state variable 'owner' with the Ethereum address 0x376902114964B34A88E5fdD7eC34113178A14fa2. This is the owner's address, and it's hard-coded in the contract.

3. Another state variable 'myNumber' is declared as an unsigned integer with an initial value of 5.

4. The addTwoValues function is defined, which takes an unsigned integer _value as a parameter. This function allows you to add the provided value to 'myNumber.'

5. The getTheValue function is defined as a public view function. It returns the current value of 'myNumber.' However, this function has a custom modifier called onlyOwner.

6. The onlyOwner modifier checks if the sender of the transaction (msg.sender) matches the 'owner' address. It uses the require statement for this purpose. If the condition is not met, the modifier will revert the transaction with the error message "You are not the owner."

7. The underscore _; in the modifier acts as a placeholder for the code of the modified function. In this case, it allows the code of the getTheValue function to execute if the condition in the modifier is satisfied.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to use a custom modifier (onlyOwner) to control access to the getTheValue function. Only the address specified as the 'owner' can call this function, ensuring that only the owner can retrieve the value of 'myNumber.'
